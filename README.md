# realdebridpy
Stupidly basic real-debrid interface.

foxyglacier is probably better: https://github.com/ruinernin/foxyglacier

But I haven't looked at it in a while and wanted something quick and easy that
was real-debrid specific.

This module has the most basic API calls needed and a really simple interactive
UI when called as a script.

### USAGE:
 Start it with: `$ python realdebrid.py YOUR_API_KEY`
 Paste magnet links in, get HTTP(S) links out. Simples.

### INSTALL:
 It needs requests, you probably have it, if not don't make a mess of your
 system python, use pipenv or something.
